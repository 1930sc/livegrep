# Vendored 3rd-party repositories

`vendor/` contains third-party repositories that have been copied, in
their entirety, into the livegrep repository for
ease-of-building. Nothing in the subdirectories of this repository
should be edited other than by direct imports of upstream.

Vendored repositories:

- utf8cpp: A
  [library for portable C++ UTF-8 handling](http://utfcpp.sourceforge.net/).

- divsufsort: The
  [libdivsufsort](https://code.google.com/p/libdivsufsort/)
  suffix-array library.
